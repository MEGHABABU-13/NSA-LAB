1)Write a shell script to find the sum, the average and the product of the four
integers entered
echo enter 4 numbers
read a b c d
((sum=a+b+c+d))
echo "Sum = $sum"

avg=$(echo "scale=2; $sum/4"| bc -l)
echo "Average = $avg"

((product=a*b*c*d))
echo "Product = $product"
 
 
output
developer@ccfl6-pc12:~/meghamca/shell$ bash calc.sh
enter 4 numbers
2 3 2 3
Sum = 10
Average = 2.50
Product = 36

2)
a) Write a program to check whether a number entered is odd or even.
b) Write a shell script to print given number in reverse order
c) Write a shell script to print sum of all digits of a given number

echo Enter a number:
read a
if(($a == 0 ))then
  echo "The number is zero"
elif (($a%2==0))then
echo "The number is even"
else
echo "The number is odd"
fi

output

developer@ccfl6-pc12:~/meghamca/shell$ bash q2.sh
Enter a number:
54
The number is even

b)

c)
echo "Enter a year:"
read year
if (($year % 4 == 0))then
  if (($year % 100 == 0))then
    if(($year % 400 == 0))then
     echo "the $year is a leap year"
    else
     echo "the $year is not a leap year"
    fi
  else
     echo "$year is a leap year."
    fi
else
    echo "$year is not a leap year."
fi   

output 

developer@ccfl6-pc12:~/meghamca/shell$ bash q2c.sh
Enter a year:
2018
