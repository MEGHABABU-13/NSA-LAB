1)Write a shell script to find the sum, the average and the product of the four
integers entered
echo enter 4 numbers
read a b c d
((sum=a+b+c+d))
echo "Sum = $sum"

avg=$(echo "scale=2; $sum/4"| bc -l)
echo "Average = $avg"

((product=a*b*c*d))
echo "Product = $product"
 
 
output
developer@ccfl6-pc12:~/meghamca/shell$ bash calc.sh
enter 4 numbers
2 3 2 3
Sum = 10
Average = 2.50
Product = 36

2)
a) Write a program to check whether a number entered is odd or even.
b) Write a shell script to print given number in reverse order
c) Write a shell script to print sum of all digits of a given number

echo "Enter option between 1 and 3:"
read n
case $n in

1)
echo "Enter number:"
read a
if(($a == 0 ))then
  echo "The number is zero"
elif (($a%2==0))then
echo "The number is even"
else
echo "The number is odd"
fi
;;

2)
rev_num=$(echo $num | rev)
echo "Reverse of number is:$rev_num"
;;

3)
echo "Enter number:"
read num
while (($num > 0))
do
sum=$((sum + num % 10))
num=$((num/10))
done
echo "Sum of digits:$sum"
;;
4)
echo"Invalid"
;;
esac

3)Write a shell script that accepts any year from the keyboard and determine
whether the year is a leap year or not.

echo "Enter a year:"
read year
if (($year % 4 == 0))then
  if (($year % 100 == 0))then
    if(($year % 400 == 0))then
     echo "the $year is a leap year"
    else
     echo "the $year is not a leap year"
    fi
  else
     echo "$year is a leap year."
    fi
else
    echo "$year is not a leap year."
fi   

output 

developer@ccfl6-pc12:~/meghamca/shell$ bash q2c.sh
Enter a year:
2018
2018 is not a leap year.
developer@ccfl6-pc12:~/meghamca/shell$ bash q2c.sh
Enter a year:
2032
2032 is a leap year.

4)
echo "Enter number:"
read num
factorial=1
for ((i=1; i<=num; i++)); do
factorial=$(echo "$factorial * $i" | bc)
done
echo "Factorial of $num is: $factorial"

output

developer@ccfl6-pc12:~/meghamca/shell$ bash q4.sh
Enter number:
5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

5)Write a program to print prime numbers from 1 to 100

echo "Prime numbers between 1 and 100:"
for (( num=2; num<=100; num++ ))
do
is_prime=1
for (( i=2; i<=num/2; i++ ))
do
if (($num % i==0))
then
is_prime=0
break
fi
done
if ((is_prime ==1))
then
echo -n "$num "
fi
done
echo

output
developer@ccfl6-pc12:~/meghamca/shell$ bash q5.sh
Prime numbers between 1 and 100:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 


8)Write a shell script to find the number of occurrences of a particular digit in a
given number.
